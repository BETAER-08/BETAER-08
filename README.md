## About me
I build complete systems end-to-end.  
My focus is on reliable architecture, clean workflow design, and automation supported by AI tools.  
I prefer minimal, robust solutions over complexity or visual noise.

## Development Principles
- Prefer explicit, predictable architecture  
- Automation over repetition  
- Functional, minimal UI  
- Code that can survive long-term, not just “work once”  
- Text-based clarity over visual decoration  
- AI as a structural assistant, not a patch tool
